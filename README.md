### The challenge

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser
- Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case
- Include seperate HTML/CSS/JavaScript files
- Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation (or HTML canvas for graphics)
- Have a repo on GitHub
- Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it
- Stick with KISS and DRY principles

### Deliverables

- A working game, built by you that runs in the browser
- A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages
- The URL of the GitHub repository for your game
- The URL of the live game on the internet
- The URL of the slides for your game's presentation
- You must present your game during Project #1 final presentations (last day of Project #1 time)

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources
